# Weather_API_Dashboard


The Weather Dashboard challenge was to create a weather dashboard that shows the current forecast and the five day forecast for a city that the user inputs. 

The user is able to select multiple cities and see their forecast. The user is able to see the city name, the temperature in F, the wind speed, humidity and the UV index. The UV index is then color coded on high UV ( UV >=10) and it changes to red, if the UV index is medium (>=5 and <=9) the background changes to yellow, if the uv index is low (<=4) the background changes to green. 

If the user clicks on a daily forecast card and then hits enter in the searchbox, then they can see that city show up again for the most up to date forecast and the 5 day forecast is shown at the top of the weekly forecast. 

If the user refreshes, the daily forecast still exists. 

If the user wants to clear the data for a new day, they can simply press the clear data button.
